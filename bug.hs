```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code compiles and runs without errors, but it's not immediately obvious that `sort` is from `Data.List` and not defined elsewhere (unless the user already knows this).

This could lead to confusion if the user attempts to use a different sorting function or forgets to import it, which might cause compile-time errors or runtime behavior that differs from expectations.
